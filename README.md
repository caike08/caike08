### Hi there! 😁

My name is Carlos Henrique Motta, and I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as a Front-End Developer since 2013 and I'm currently working as a Coder at [Socialbakers](https://www.socialbakers.com/), creating new and maintaining existing UI components, cooperating with product development feature teams, coding across all product sections, and close cooperation with UI/UX design team.

I also worked at [Solidaridad Network](https://www.solidaridadnetwork.org/), using technology to create a positive impact in people's lives, through technological inclusion.

I aim to help develop a better world by using technology as a key to empowering people and help them to see technology as a life changer.

In my free time I like to watch soccer (⚽️) or play any kind of old-fashioned game that brings me some nostalgia, such as Counter-Strike (🔫) or Age of Empires (🏰). I also like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
